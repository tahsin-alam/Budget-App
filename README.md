# Budget-App

Budget App calculates your budget given the list of income and expenses from the description menu. 

The time is set to the current month and year followed by two different boxes for each income and expenses which calculates the total income and expenses that we add to our list and then gives us a final budget for the specific month which could be positive or negative. 

It starts with choosing a type where + represents the income and - represents the expense followed by description and the final value for that type. We can add up to as many as item as we wants and it calculates the final budget for the current month and year.
